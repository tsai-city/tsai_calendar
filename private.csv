1,Food Product Intensive Session 2,2019-10-10,1:30 PM,4:30 PM,"For the food-obsessed, the secret chefs, and the ambitious eaters—step away from your studies with an extracurricular intensive (a deep-dive, 5-session workshop) you can really dig your teeth into from Tsai CITY, the Landscape Lab, and the Sustainable Food Program. Over five weeks, the 5-session food intensive will explore how to take an idea or prototype for a food product—like your crazy idea for plankton-based pasta, the recipe you’re working on for a super-high-tech energy bar, or the local-food-based meals you've been stocking your freezer with—from a big idea in your dorm kitchen to the global market.



The five sessions will walk you through the steps of transforming an idea into a product, and a product into production: addressing ethics, sourcing ingredients, manufacturing food products, defining your brand, taking goods to market, and working towards scale. Learn from industry experts about the best techniques for creating your own secret sauce, the right person to talk to for your key ingredients, and what a recipe for success looks like in the food industry. Develop your idea, your pitch, and your brand through discussion with industry experts, group critiques of what you're working on, and in-depth mentorship."

6,Financing Innovative Ideas Intensive Session 1,2019-10-28,6:00 PM,9:00 PM,"This will be Tsai CITY’s first-ever Intensive focused on finance. We’ll explore how to raise and direct capital towards innovation that makes the world a better place.

Students will work in teams to build financial models, develop financing strategies, and communicate impact in creative ways that might not be apparent from the numbers alone. Students will have time over winter break to ground-truth their assumptions and build out their models in detail (students can dedicate as much time as they see fit during this period). Then they’ll reconvene in the spring to share their work and assess what others have produced.

The Intensive will be a great opportunity to explore issues at the intersection of finance, entrepreneurship, and social/environmental responsibility. "
