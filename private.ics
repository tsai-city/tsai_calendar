DESCRIPTION:For the food-obsessed\, the secret chefs\, and the ambitious e
 aters—step away from your studies with an extracurricular intensive (a d
 eep-dive\, 5-session workshop) you can really dig your teeth into from Tsa
 i CITY\, the Landscape Lab\, and the Sustainable Food Program. Over five w
 eeks\, the 5-session food intensive will explore how to take an idea or pr
 ototype for a food product—like your crazy idea for plankton-based pasta
 \, the recipe you’re working on for a super-high-tech energy bar\, or th
 e local-food-based meals you've been stocking your freezer with—from a b
 ig idea in your dorm kitchen to the global market.\n\n\n\nThe five session
 s will walk you through the steps of transforming an idea into a product\,
  and a product into production: addressing ethics\, sourcing ingredients\,
  manufacturing food products\, defining your brand\, taking goods to marke
 t\, and working towards scale. Learn from industry experts about the best 
 techniques for creating your own secret sauce\, the right person to talk t
 o for your key ingredients\, and what a recipe for success looks like in t
 he food industry. Develop your idea\, your pitch\, and your brand through 
 discussion with industry experts\, group critiques of what you're working 
 on\, and in-depth mentorship.

DESCRIPTION:This will be Tsai CITY’s first-ever Intensive focused on fin
 ance. We’ll explore how to raise and direct capital towards innovation t
 hat makes the world a better place.\n\nStudents will work in teams to buil
 d financial models\, develop financing strategies\, and communicate impact
  in creative ways that might not be apparent from the numbers alone. Stude
 nts will have time over winter break to ground-truth their assumptions and
  build out their models in detail (students can dedicate as much time as t
 hey see fit during this period). Then they’ll reconvene in the spring to
  share their work and assess what others have produced.\n\nThe Intensive w
 ill be a great opportunity to explore issues at the intersection of financ
 e\, entrepreneurship\, and social/environmental responsibility.
