DESCRIPTION:[LAURA\, please edit -- looking to attract non-clinical majors
 \; have had good success in prior cohorts with PhD students given their le
 vel of commitment. This workshop would be entryway to Spring cohort for a 
 select group to do project work.]\nAre you interested in tackling healthca
 re’s toughest challenges? Do you have a unique way of approaching a prob
 lem and arriving at a creative solution? The Clinical Redesign team is int
 erested in engaging students of non-clinical and diverse disciplines to ta
 ke a first-hand look at challenges facing frontline healthcare providers. 
 The Clinical Redesign team helps YNHHS staff “rethink” how to deliver 
 care\, “realign” resources to better meet patients’ needs\, and “r
 edesign” the processes that are crucial to the successful\, sustainable 
 delivery of that care. Come and learn more about Clinical Redesign in this
  2-session workshop and provide a fresh perspective to healthcare’s toug

 y at the cusp of interplanetary civilization\, it's time to build the tech
 nologies\, tools\, and human experiences of our Sci-Fi Space Future. To do
  so\, we unite artists\, scientists\, engineers\, and designers in creatin
 g space technologies that envision a bold and culturally rich “new space
  age”-- from astro-bacteria wearables\, to open-access and shareable cub
 esat constellations\, to musical instruments for our space voyages\, to fl
 oating space habitats\, to advanced zero-gravity 3D printing. The MIT Spac
 e Exploration Initiative (SEI) supports 40+ research projects\, regular ze
 ro-g parabolic flights\, suborbital and orbital launch research deployment
 s\, and a team of 50+ students\, staff\, and faculty--we aim to found a re
 al-life Starfleet Academy. The SEI is coming to Yale this fall to lead wor
 kshops in four of our core research areas and introduce student teams to o
 pportunities to fly in Zero Gravity. We hope you'll join us! Feel free to 
 join for as many of the morning and afternoon sessions as you like--you do
  not need to attend all four topic areas.

DESCRIPTION:Space will be hackable. Space will be playful.\n\nWith humanit
 y at the cusp of interplanetary civilization\, it's time to build the tech
 nologies\, tools\, and human experiences of our Sci-Fi Space Future. To do
  so\, we unite artists\, scientists\, engineers\, and designers in creatin
 g space technologies that envision a bold and culturally rich “new space
  age”-- from astro-bacteria wearables\, to open-access and shareable cub
 esat constellations\, to musical instruments for our space voyages\, to fl
 oating space habitats\, to advanced zero-gravity 3D printing. The MIT Spac
 e Exploration Initiative (SEI) supports 40+ research projects\, regular ze
 ro-g parabolic flights\, suborbital and orbital launch research deployment
 s\, and a team of 50+ students\, staff\, and faculty--we aim to found a re
 al-life Starfleet Academy. The SEI is coming to Yale this fall to lead wor
 kshops in four of our core research areas and introduce student teams to o
 pportunities to fly in Zero Gravity. We hope you'll join us! Feel free to 
 join for as many of the morning and afternoon sessions as you like--you do
  not need to attend all four topic areas.
