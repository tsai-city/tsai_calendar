5,"Yale Innovation, Remixed: Event & Reception",2019-10-24,4:00 PM,6:00 PM,"Join the Tsai Center for Innovative Thinking at Yale (Tsai CITY) and the Center for Science and Social Science Information (CSSSI) for a lively conversation and reception to celebrate the opening of Yale Innovation Remixed, a media exhibit at the CSSSI. The exhibit explores Tsai CITY's programs alongside stories of Yale innovations that span time periods, disciplines, and focus areas.

At this event, you'll hear about the exhibit and Yale's ecosystem for entrepreneurship and innovation. Inspiring student innovators will share the stories behind the projects and ventures they're currently building, before we continue the conversation over refreshments. Throughout the program, we'll consider the art of the remix: taking different elements or ideas and finding new ways to combine them — creating something novel in the process."
6,Clinical Redesign Open Workshop 1,2019-10-25,12:00 PM,1:30 PM,"[LAURA, please edit -- looking to attract non-clinical majors; have had good success in prior cohorts with PhD students given their level of commitment. This workshop would be entryway to Spring cohort for a select group to do project work.]
Are you interested in tackling healthcare’s toughest challenges? Do you have a unique way of approaching a problem and arriving at a creative solution? The Clinical Redesign team is interested in engaging students of non-clinical and diverse disciplines to take a first-hand look at challenges facing frontline healthcare providers. The Clinical Redesign team helps YNHHS staff “rethink” how to deliver care, “realign” resources to better meet patients’ needs, and “redesign” the processes that are crucial to the successful, sustainable delivery of that care. Come and learn more about Clinical Redesign in this 2-session workshop and provide a fresh perspective to healthcare’s toughest challenges. "

9,Space Exploration Workshop Series: Prototyping our Life in Space,2019-11-01,10:00 AM,3:00 PM,"Space will be hackable. Space will be playful.

With humanity at the cusp of interplanetary civilization, it's time to build the technologies, tools, and human experiences of our Sci-Fi Space Future. To do so, we unite artists, scientists, engineers, and designers in creating space technologies that envision a bold and culturally rich “new space age”-- from astro-bacteria wearables, to open-access and shareable cubesat constellations, to musical instruments for our space voyages, to floating space habitats, to advanced zero-gravity 3D printing. The MIT Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) supports 40+ research projects, regular zero-g parabolic flights, suborbital and orbital launch research deployments, and a team of 50+ students, staff, and faculty--we aim to found a real-life Starfleet Academy. The SEI is coming to Yale this fall to lead workshops in four of our core research areas and introduce student teams to opportunities to fly in Zero Gravity. We hope you'll join us! Feel free to join for as many of the morning and afternoon sessions as you like--you do not need to attend all four topic areas."

While working at companies such as Chanel, Ann Taylor and Elie Tahari, Mona Bijoor saw an opportunity to eliminate many of the inefficiencies in the fashion supply chain and seized upon it. She founded JOOR, an online ecosystem that seamlessly connects brands and retailers by unlocking vital data between the two parties. She has grown JOOR to now serve over 500 fashion brands and 30,000 retailers worldwide. In her recent book, Startups and Downs, Mona shares her wisdom and stories (hers and others’) about how the best entrepreneurs think about failure—as it’s happening and in hindsight—and ultimately win."

17,The Match,2019-11-08,4:00 PM,6:00 PM,"Maybe you're getting an idea or project off the ground, and you're looking for co-founders or collaborators to help you get there. On the flip side, maybe you don't have an idea in mind, but you're interested in applying your skills or joining a team that's building something awesome. No matter which group you fall into, how do you find collaborators, figure out the right fit, and align on goals?

Join Tsai CITY and Thinkspaces for The Match: a workshop and ""speed dating"" session that will help you answer these questions. Peter Boyd — a Tsai CITY mentor in residence who's worked alongside innovators like Richard Branson to combat climate change as a senior leader at the B Team and the Carbon War Room, led Virgin Mobile South Africa as CEO, and more — will guide you through key strategies for finding and forming effective collaborations and teams. You'll then move into conversations with fellow participants co-hosted by Thinkspaces, a student-run venture that aims to ""make collaboration easier by connecting you with other Yalies who get things done, just like you."" Whether you're looking for teammates or looking to join a team, you'll leave the workshop with new skills for finding the right match — and maybe your next collaborator."

20,OpenEarth Collabathon - Day 1 (Launch),2019-11-14,9:00 AM,8:00 PM,"We are organizing a non-competitive open and collaborative hackathon (collabathon) to build on and develop a globally trusted tool to monitor Earth’s atmospheric carbon budget and global climate accounting. The initiative started with a design sprint on December 8th, coinciding with the UNFCCC COP24, continued with a Hackathon in Yale-NUS Singapore and finally consolidated over the summer of 2019 incubating a first prototype of the platform. The output of this open and collaborative effort — Open Climate — is an open source software-based framework that would act as an accounting tool for Earth system governance; an impartial algorithmic system that can achieve decentralized and immutable consensus on one of Earth’s most important vital signs as well as provide accountability to all climate actors —from countries to cities and companies— on their action pledges towards a net zero carbon future."

23,Skills for Sustainable Innovation: Marketing & Communications for Responsible Ventures,2019-11-15,2:00 PM,4:00 PM,"Join Vincent Stanley (CBEY Resident Fellow and Director, Patagonia Philosophy) in a workshop focused on marketing & communications for responsible ventures.

Through discussion and exercises, this workshop will explore why and how businesses that assume full responsibility for their social and environmental impacts can and must be transparent and consistent in marketing and communications with all stakeholders—employees, suppliers, NGOs and neighbors as well as customers. 

Robust communication of responsible practices (and the challenges they create) supports a healthy business culture that builds equity over time through quality, innovation and continuous improvement. A radically transparent approach to marketing also creates internal discipline that helps a company focus on strategies that both identify and realize its best purpose. "
